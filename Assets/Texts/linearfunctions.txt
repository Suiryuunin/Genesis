Linear Functions and Slope The easiest type of function to consider is a linear function Linear functions have the form f(x)=ax+b where a and b are constants In Figure 1.15 we see examples of linear functions when a is positive negative and zero Note that if a>0 the graph of the line rises as x increases In other words f(x)=ax+b is increasing on (-∞,∞) If a<0 the graph of the line falls as x increases In this case f(x)=ax+b is decreasing on (-∞,∞) If a=0 the line is horizontal As suggested by Figure 1.15 the graph of any linear function is a line One of the distinguishing features of a line is its slope The slope is the change in y for each unit change in x The slope measures both the steepness and the direction of a line If the slope is positive the line points upward when moving from left to right If the slope is negative the line points downward when moving from left to right If the slope is zero the line is horizontal To calculate the slope of a line we need to determine the ratio of the change in y versus the change in x To do so we choose any two points (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) on the line and calculate y2−y1x2−x1 In Figure 1.16 we see this ratio is independent of the points chosen
